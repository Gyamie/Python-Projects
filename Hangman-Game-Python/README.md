# Hangman-Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game project! This Python script allows you to play the classic game of Hangman where you guess letters to reveal a hidden word. Below is a brief overview of the project and instructions on how to play:

## Overview
The Hangman Game script randomly selects a word from a predefined list of words and provides you with a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly. For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn. If you guess all the letters correctly before running out of attempts, you win the game!

## How to Play
1. Run the Python script in your preferred Python environment.
2. The script will display the Hangman logo and choose a word from the predefined list.
3. You will be presented with blanks representing each letter of the word.
4. Guess a letter by entering it when prompted.
5. If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word. If not, a part of the hangman will be drawn, and you will lose a life.
6. Keep guessing letters until you either correctly guess the word or run out of lives.
7. If you correctly guess the word, you win the game! If you run out of lives, you lose.
