# Calculator Generator

Welcome to the Calculator project! This Python script allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Below is a brief overview of the project and instructions on how to use it:

## Overview
The Calculator script provides functions for performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers. It also allows for continuous calculations by prompting the user to choose an operation after each calculation.

## Supported Operations
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)

## How to Use
1. Run the Python script in your preferred Python environment.
2. Enter the first number when prompted.
3. Choose an operation from the available options: '+', '-', '*', or '/'.
4. Enter the second number when prompted.
5. The script will then output the result of the calculation.
6. You can choose to continue with the result of the previous calculation by typing 'y' or start a new calculation by typing 'n'.

Example

    -
    *
    /
    Pick an operation: *
    what's the next number?:5
    10 * 5 = 50
    Type 'y' to continue with 50 or type 'n' to start.: y
    Pick an operation: +
    what's the next number?:20
    50 + 20 = 70
    Type 'y' to continue with 70 or type 'n' to start.: n
